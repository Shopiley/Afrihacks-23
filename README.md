## Proposed Solution:
We aim to develop a comprehensive financial web app tailored to the unique needs of women, offering a dedicated platform to save towards maternity-related expenses. This app will not only facilitate savings for medical services but extend its functionality to include long-term financial planning for the child's future, covering aspects such as school fees and college expenses. It will also provide access to investment opportunities and loans, creating a comprehensive platform to address the financial challenges associated with maternal and child healthcare.

This initiative aligns with the goal of promoting financial inclusivity and preparedness, ensuring a healthier start and future for mothers and their children.
